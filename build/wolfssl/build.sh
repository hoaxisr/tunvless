# Build wolfSSL from source into a static archive — one recipe for every target.
#
#     sh build/wolfssl/build.sh <wolfSSL sources> <output .a> [asm|noasm]
#
# Compiler and flags come from the environment: CC (default cc), CFLAGS (target, optimization),
# AR (default ar). STEER_WOLFSSL_DEFS adds library options that are not in user_settings.h: only
# the crypto tests use it (certificate issuing and a TLS server for the peer side, see the
# Makefile); tunvless builds never do.
#
# Next to the archive goes <output>.cflags — exactly the flags src/lib/scrypto.c must be compiled
# with against this archive (defines and -I). Not "roughly the same": STEER_WOLFSSL_ASM changes the
# layout of Aes (the AES-NI fields), and scrypto.c compiled without it next to a library built with
# it would write past the fields. So callers read the flags from the file instead of deriving them.
#
# WHY A RECIPE AND NOT configure. Cross builds (the Entware SDK, any CC=...) get one list of .c
# files, -DWOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS and one options header (build/wolfssl/user_settings.h — the
# reasons for each option are there) — wolfSSL's own way for embedded builds — instead of
# autotools probing a foreign compiler.
#
# THE FILE LIST IS EXPLICIT, not "everything in wolfcrypt/src": more than a hundred files of which a
# third are needed. A forgotten one shows at once as an undefined reference at link time.
#
# A FILE THAT FAILS TO COMPILE IS NOT HIDDEN: its errors are printed and the build stops.
