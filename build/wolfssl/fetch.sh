# wolfSSL sources for the build: download the release, VERIFY THE CHECKSUM, unpack.
#
#     sh build/wolfssl/fetch.sh <directory>
#     sh build/wolfssl/fetch.sh version      prints the version
#
# THE VERSION AND CHECKSUM ARE WRITTEN HERE ONLY. `make fetch`, the Entware package build
# (.github/workflows/build.yml) and the tests all get the sources through this script, so they
# share one version, and changing it is an edit of the two lines below in one commit.
#
# WHY A DOWNLOAD AND NOT SOURCES IN THE TREE. A wolfSSL release is 35 MB and over a thousand
# files, of which the build needs a little over thirty (build/wolfssl/build.sh). Keeping them in
# the tree would put foreign code into every clone and every history rewrite, for what one
# checksum verifies.
#
# WHY THIS CHECKSUM. The tarball is GitHub's archive of the release tag (the OpenWrt package,
# package/libs/wolfssl, takes the same one), and that is what wolfSSL signs:
# wolfssl-<version>.tar.gz.asc sits next to the release. The signature was checked with
# wolfSSL's key (A2A4 8E7B CB96 C5BE CB98 7314 EBC8 0E41 5CA2 9677, "wolfSSL
# <secure@wolfssl.com>") when the checksum was recorded here. The build checks the checksum, not
# the signature, so it needs neither gpg nor a key server.
#
# 5.9.4 (25 September 2026) fixes six CVEs found in 5.9.2 and older (ChangeLog.md: CVE-2026-93302,
# -89102, -89136, -93304, -89133, -89134). Not all of them touch our configuration, but there is
# no reason to build a release with known holes.
