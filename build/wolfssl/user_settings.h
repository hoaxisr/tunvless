/* wolfSSL build options for tunvless — the ONLY place they are written.
 *
 * Every wolfSSL .c sees this file (-DWOLFSSL_USER_SETTINGS), and so does the one tunvless file
 * that includes wolfSSL headers, src/lib/scrypto.c. That is a correctness condition, not taste:
 * the layout of wolfSSL structures (Aes, wc_Sha256, Hmac...) depends on these macros, and a
 * library built with one set next to a caller built with another corrupts memory silently. So
 * the options live nowhere else — not on command lines, not in configure.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEEDED. The TLS 1.3 and REALITY client is our own (src/proto/tls); wolfSSL provides
 * primitives only: SHA-256/384/512, HMAC, HKDF, AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-CTR (VLESS
 * encryption), X25519, ML-KEM-768 and ML-DSA-65 verification, and X.509 chain verification with
 * name and validity (RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 and PSS, ECDSA P-256/P-384 signatures). The chain is checked
 * by wolfSSL's X509 store, which is why part of its TLS layer (OPENSSL_EXTRA) is built.
 *
 * WHAT IS LEFT OUT ON PURPOSE: TLS 1.2 and older, a TLS server, QUIC, DH, DSA, DES, RC4, MD4,
 * PSK, PBKDF, the filesystem (certverify.c reads the roots itself, into a buffer) and socket I/O.
 *
 * SIZE. tunvless links wolfSSL statically with -ffunction-sections and --gc-sections, so what is
 * built but never called does not reach the binary.
