# The WHOLE tunnel on a local test bed: no real node and no internet.
#
# TCP synthesis, retransmission and the spreading of connections over threads only show on real
# traffic; a unit test cannot reach them. With a real node every check would depend on someone
# else's server, and "did not recover after loss" could not be told from "the node went down".
#
# Setup: a network namespace with a fake VLESS server (tests/fake-vless.py), the tunnel
# (tunvless) and wget as the client. Loss is added by an nft rule on INPUT from the tunnel
# device, so exactly the packets we synthesized are lost.
#
# Usage: tests/run-tunnel.sh [loss_percent] [streams]

# Eight megabytes: this tests RECOVERY, not speed, and a larger download would be slow for a
# reason unrelated to the tunnel. The client is local, so our 18 KB segment reaches it as ONE
# segment, not thirteen, and its kernel holds the ACK on the delayed-ACK timer. On a real network
# the segment is split, ACKs come often, and there is no such slowdown.
