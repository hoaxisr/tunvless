/* HTTP/2 in h2.c: flow control windows, a series of requests on one connection (packet-up), and
 * frame parsing (Huffman :status, RST_STREAM, PADDED, PRIORITY).
 *
 * The server's send window (send_win, send_win_conn) is int32_t, and a negative value is legal:
 * a SETTINGS with INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE below 65535 subtracts the difference from the window
 * already granted (RFC 7540 §6.9.2). Compared through size_t, a negative window becomes
 * 1.8e19, the check in h2_write never fires, the frame goes past the window, and the server
 * answers RST_STREAM with FLOW_CONTROL_ERROR. From outside a grpc/xhttp node "sometimes drops",
 * while h2_write returned success and the error came later from elsewhere. Gaps like this, between
 * "returned 0" and "actually broke the stream", are what this test is for.
 *
 * The SOURCE of h2.c is included: send_win is state that cannot be set from outside, and a
 * command in the engine just for the test would change the engine for the test. I/O is replaced
 * through struct h2_io, the abstraction made for that, so there is no network or TLS here. h2.c
 * takes only the constant TLS13_MAX_PLAIN from tls13.h and calls nothing, and tls13.h includes
 * only src/lib/scrypto.h, with no crypto library types, so no header stubs are needed. */
