/* The TUN device: opening its queues, reading packets (with receive offload), parsing IPv4 headers

 *
 * The kernel hands us whole IP packets, not connections; stack.c rebuilds the connections and
 * carries each over its own VLESS flow. What is carried:
 *   TCP  — a VLESS flow per connection, with its state tracked;
 *   UDP  — a VLESS flow per address-port pair, datagrams with a 2-byte length (VLESS cmd=2);
 *          QUIC and WireGuard go this way;
 *   ICMP — not carried: ping through a proxy needs emulation, which only helps diagnostics and
 *          misleads (a ping that answers does not mean the path works).
