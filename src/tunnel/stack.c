/* Tunnel stack: packets from the TUN device become flows to the node, and back.
 *
 * The kernel hands us IP packets; the node accepts connections. This file bridges the two: for
 * each TCP connection (and UDP flow) from the TUN device it opens a flow to the node and carries
 * the bytes, acknowledging them to the client the way a real stack would.
 *
 * There is no protocol here. Everything about the node belongs to the dialer (dialer.h): a
 * connection's session is opaque to the stack, and VLESS is the dialer in proto/vless/vldial.c.
 * The entry point is src/main.c.
 *
 * This is not a full TCP stack, and need not be. There is no congestion control: the client runs
 * its own on its side, the server on its side. The job is narrower: answer the SYN, take data in
 * order, pass on what arrives, retransmit what is unacknowledged, and close.
 *
 * Retransmission TOWARDS THE CLIENT is required: without it one lost segment hangs the connection
 * for good (the client keeps acknowledging the old data, we keep sending new). It costs a ring of
 * up to RTX_CAP bytes per connection that carries data.
 *
 * There is no REASSEMBLY buffer: an out-of-order segment from the client is dropped, and the
 * client, which has a full stack, retransmits it. Retransmitting is the sender's job and filling
 * holes the receiver's; we pass received data on at once, so only the first is needed.

/* ---- connection table: hot fields apart from the bulky session ------------------------
 *
 * The loop walks the connections several times per turn (epoll set, pending jobs, deferred ACKs,
 * deadlines). With the session (TLS record buffers, cipher contexts, HTTP/2 state) in the same
 * record, the hot fields of each connection sat on pages kilobytes apart: 320 records of 19 KB is
 * 5.8 MB, against a 32 KB L1 and no L2 on a MIPS 24Kc. Measured on x86_64 with 8 of 320 slots
 * busy: 3.4 us per turn for the walks against 0.15 us over a compact live list; on the 24Kc the
 * walks alone capped the loop near 1500 turns per second, invisible in every other counter.
 *
 * Hence three rules that depend on each other:
 *
 *   1. the bulky half lives in a SEPARATE array (dialer sessions); the loop never touches it, and
 *      beyond its first page it becomes resident only for connections that actually do I/O;
 *   2. the hot record is small (checked below), and the fields the loop reads come first;
 *   3. no loop walks the WHOLE table: they walk g_live, which holds only busy slots, and lookup by
 *      flow goes through a hash.
 *
 * A live list alone would not help while a record is 19 KB, and vice versa. */

/* The bulky half is the dialer's session (dialer.h): the link to the node and the protocol state
 * of this flow. It is opaque to the stack, and the dialer names its size (sess_size); for VLESS it
 * is about 40 KB — TLS record buffers of both links, cipher contexts, HTTP/2, Vision, datagram
 * reassembly (struct vl_sess in proto/vless/vldial.c). The sessions are a separate array in the

/* ---- the window WE advertise to the client ---------------------------------------------
 *
 * The client keeps at most the advertised window in flight, so an upload is capped at the window
 * divided by the round trip: the network to the client plus the time until we read its packets
 * and acknowledge them (once per loop pass, flush_acks). A fixed 65535 caps it at 65535/RTT
 * whatever the node and the CPU can do: 175 Mbit/s at 3 ms, 87 at 6, 22 at 24. Measured on an x86
 * bench (network namespaces, Xray 26.3.27 node with Reality and Vision, a 6.1 ms round trip to
 * the client), upload with one flow / eight flows in Mbit/s: 64 KB — 83 / 621, 256 KB —
 * 325 / 1340, 1 MiB — 1164 / 1521, 4 MiB — 1286 / 1477. At a 0.1 ms round trip the window does
 * not matter: the node is the limit.
 *
 * A client that offers window scaling in its SYN (ws_seen) gets our option with shift
 * g_rcv_shift in the SYN-ACK; the SYN-ACK's own window is 65535 unscaled, since a SYN window is
 * never scaled (RFC 7323, 2.2). After that its window field is g_rcv_wnd >> g_rcv_shift
 * (rcv_win_field). A client without the option gets no option back (it may only answer a SYN
 * that has it) and a window of 65535. The shift is the smallest whose 16-bit field holds the
 * ceiling, at most 14. The option matters both ways: scaling is on only if both sides send it,
 * and without ours the client would not scale the window it advertises to us, while client_room
 * scales it — we would keep up to 128 times too much in flight, and the receiver drops whatever
 * lies beyond its window.
 *
 * THE CEILING. The stack holds no client data: what arrives goes to the node in the same pass.
 * But it sits in kernel memory twice: in the TUN queue until the loop reads it, and in the send
 * buffer of the socket to the node until the node acknowledges it. So the window promises no
 * more than the kernel would give a real TCP receiver or sender: the smaller of the third values
 * of net.ipv4.tcp_rmem and tcp_wmem. The kernel derives them from memory (tcp_init in
 * net/ipv4/tcp.c: 1/128 of the pressure threshold; 128 KB to 6 MB for receive, 64 KB to 4 MB for
 * send): 4 MB on a desktop, about 700 KB on a 128 MB router (computed, not checked on one). The
 * owner changes it with a sysctl, or directly with STEER_TUN_RCVWND=N (0 — 65535 unscaled). If
 * the files cannot be read, 65535.
 *
 * THE COST. Behind a narrow link to the node the client fills the whole window, and the backlog
 * sits in the TUN queue and the socket buffer. Measured with a 50 Mbit/s link to the node, a
 * 4 MiB ceiling and 6 ms to the client: the upload uses the whole link, but the connection's RTT
 * at the client is 534-547 ms instead of 6. A short queue would need tracking the rate at which
 * the node accepts, which is not done here.
 *
 * NOT HERE. A window of "free space in the socket's send buffer" (SO_SNDBUF minus SIOCOUTQ)
 * follows the round trip to the NODE, not to the client (the kernel grows that buffer with the
 * node's congestion window): with a fast close node it stuck at 100-200 KB (148, 151 and 1382
 * Mbit/s in three runs instead of 1286-1349). A brake "65535 while more than 65535 bytes are
 * unsent in the socket" (SIOCOUTQNSD) made the window flap (1079 Mbit/s instead of 1404).
 * Behind a narrow link the loop, shared by all its connections, blocks in the write to the node
 * (SO_SNDTIMEO) and other connections' ACKs wait in the TUN queue; that happens with any window.
 * There is no reassembly buffer and no SACK (the SYN-ACK offers MSS and window scale only), so
 * the larger the window, the more the client resends after one loss (0.3% loss at 6 ms: 23
 * Mbit/s and 400 TCP retransmits with 65535, 24 Mbit/s and 3000-12000 with the large window).
 * The client's window towards us (client_room) is unaffected.
