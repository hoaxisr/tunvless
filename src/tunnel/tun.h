/* ---- COALESCING ADJACENT SEGMENTS INTO ONE WRITE (GRO in reverse) ----------------
 *
 * WHY. A write to TUN is a full pass through the kernel's stack: per write the kernel builds an
 * skb, runs it through ip_rcv and tcp_v4_rcv, queues it on the socket and wakes the reader. A
 * whole-machine perf profile of a live tunnel showed the sending side spending 1% of its time on
 * its own crypto and the rest in tun_get_user, __alloc_skb and syscall overhead, one pass per 1439
 * bytes. Marked as GSO, one pass covers eight packets: the kernel takes them as one large segment
 * and splits them inside its stack (and often hands them to the receiving socket unsplit).
 * wireguard-go uses the same trick; tun_write_data uses the same offload.
 *
 * NO BUFFER. Collecting packets into a 16-64 KB buffer would need one buffer per connection, real
 * memory on a 128 MB router. It is not needed: the frames of one decrypted record already lie
 * contiguously in memory, so a single writev lists their payloads as vectors. Only the FIRST
 * packet's header is edited in place.
 *
 * NO ADDED DELAY. Only frames already read from one record are coalesced; nothing waits for the
 * next one. The caller must call tun_gro_flush at the end of each record, so a packet lives no
 * longer than one loop pass. There are no timers: on a router latency costs more than throughput.
 *
 * WHAT IS COALESCED: only what the kernel will split back byte for byte. IPv4 without options, the
 * same flow (addresses and ports), consecutive sequence numbers, equal ttl, tos, ack, window and
 * TCP options, flags exactly ACK (or ACK|PSH on the last one: the kernel puts PSH and FIN only on
 * the last piece). Everything else (ICMP, UDP, fragments, SYN, RST, a changed window) goes as its
 * own write. The rules are strict on purpose: coalescing too much hands the client a stream with
 * reordered or corrupted bytes, which only a packet dump reveals. */
