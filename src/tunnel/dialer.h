/* Dialer: the protocol the tunnel stack (stack.c) uses to carry the client's TCP and UDP flows to a
 * node.
 *
 * The stack knows the TUN device, the client's connections (SYN-ACK, window, retransmits, early
 * data, fragment reassembly) and the connector threads. It knows nothing of the protocol: each
 * client connection has an opaque dialer session of sess_size bytes, and for everything about the
 * node (connecting, the request header, framing, parsing the answer) the stack calls this table.
 * The one dialer is VLESS (proto/vless/vldial.c); another protocol would be another dialer, not a
 * change to the stack.
 *
 * The boundary follows what the stack knows, not what suits VLESS, so the table has no "header" and
 * no Vision. send gets the client's bytes and the flow key and decides what to put in front;
 * deliver hands the stack the bare payload through emit: stream pieces for TCP, whole datagrams for
 * UDP. One session per client connection holds both the link to the node and the protocol state of
 * the flow; where one ends and the other begins is the dialer's business (see take).
 *
 * The table has more than VLESS needs: DC_UDP_OWN, DC_ACK_PACED and rcv_wnd_max serve dialers with
 * their own UDP sockets or a bounded send queue, and VLESS sets none of them. The node questions
 * (peer_of, match, stale, lost) are answered by the node pool (pool.c), which wraps the dialer.
 *
 * There is no multiplexing (several client flows on one link, XUDP, Mux.Cool): the stack keeps one
 * session per flow (see udp_packet in stack.c).
