/* The cryptographic primitives layer: everything the protocols need from the crypto library.
 *
 * Protocol code (src/proto) does not call the crypto library itself: it calls these functions,
 * with wolfCrypt behind them. The library is visible in exactly one file, scrypto.c, so
 * replacing it means editing one file under an unchanged header.
 *
 * No library types here, and that is a promise: tls13.h includes this header, and through it so
 * do unit tests built without the crypto library (neither its headers nor its objects). Such a
 * test supplies its own sc_* functions where it needs them.
 *
 * Contexts are opaque and of fixed size, not allocated by the library:
 *
 *   - struct tls13 and struct tls13_keys hold contexts by value and themselves live inside
 *     connections, in the tunnel's static tables and on the handshake stack. Allocating per key
 *     would add a malloc per direction, an out-of-memory path in a dozen places and a leak at
 *     every missed free. Storage inside the struct cannot be lost: it has no pointer;
 *   - the storage size is a constant of this header, and scrypto.c checks it against the real
 *     sizeof of the wolfSSL type at compile time (_Static_assert). If a new wolfSSL version or a
 *     new option in build/wolfssl/user_settings.h grows the struct, the build fails instead of
 *     corrupting the next field at run time;
 *   - the alignment (16 bytes) is declared on the storage itself, so it holds wherever a context
 *     lives, the stack included.
 *
 * Threads: each context belongs to one thread; functions without a context (sc_hash, sc_hmac,
 * sc_hkdf_*, sc_x25519*) are safe from any. The root store (struct sc_roots) is shared by the
 * process; chain verification serializes internally.
 *
 * Return codes: 0 on success, a negative code from the list below on failure. Callers map them
 * to their own (TLS13_ECRYPTO, CERTV_* ...): the layer need not know what the protocol calls a
 * failure. */
