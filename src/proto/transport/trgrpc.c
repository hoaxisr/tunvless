/* The grpc transport: the protocol stream in gRPC messages inside one HTTP/2 stream (the upper
 * layer of transport.h).
 *
 * grpc and xhttp are both HTTP/2, and they differ less than it seems: both open one stream with
 * a POST and carry bytes in its body. They differ in exactly two things: the path, and whether
 * data is wrapped in gRPC messages.
 *
 * gRPC message format (gRPC over HTTP/2 spec plus Xray's schema from stream.proto):
 *
 *   compressed flag  1 byte  (0 — not compressed; compression is never offered or accepted)
 *   length           4 bytes big-endian
 *   body             protobuf message Hunk { bytes data = 1 }: 0x0A, length, bytes
 *
 * MultiHunk (mode=multi) differs only in that field 1 may repeat. On send a single field is a
 * valid MultiHunk, so it is the same as Hunk; on receive repeats are handled because fields are
 * read to the end of the message.
