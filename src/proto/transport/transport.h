/* Transport: how a protocol stream (VLESS) reaches its node.
 *
 * Three layers, bottom up, each in its own files:
 *
 *   socket      TCP to the node over every address of its name, with SO_MARK and SO_BINDTODEVICE
 *               when set (trdial.c);
 *   security    the link's security= field: none, tls, reality (trsec.c, struct security_ops);
 *   transport   the link's type= field: tcp, grpc, xhttp, ws, httpupgrade (transport.c,
 *               trgrpc.c, trxhttp.c, trws.c, trupgrade.c; struct transport_ops).
 *
 * Security and transport are two tables, not one chain of layers ("tcp -> tls -> grpc"): in the
 * node link they are two independent fields and any pair is valid (grpc over reality, xhttp over
 * tls, tcp with no security). One chain would need rules on which layer may sit on which, a
 * second way of saying what the two fields already say. Security kinds differ only in the
 * handshake: after it tls and reality carry the same TLS 1.3 records, and none is the bare
 * socket. So security_ops has one function, and after the handshake the stream goes through the
 * shared link code (tr_link_* in transport.c).
 *
 * Users: the VLESS client (proto/vless/client.c: vless_connect and the node probe) and, through
 * it, the tunnel dialer (proto/vless/vldial.c). The transport knows nothing of the protocol: it
 * gets the node as struct tr_node, the link fields that concern it, pointing into the parsed node.
