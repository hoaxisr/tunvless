/* The ws transport: the protocol stream in WebSocket frames (RFC 6455) after an Upgrade request
 * (the top layer in transport.h). The Upgrade request and the 101 answer are shared with
 * httpupgrade (trupgrade.c); this file is only the frames.
 *
 * SENDING AS XRAY DOES. The Xray client writes each of its writes to gorilla/websocket as one
 * WriteMessage(BinaryMessage); its write buffer is 4096 bytes (websocket/dialer.go:
 * WriteBufferSize), and gorilla cuts a longer message into 4096-byte frames: the first binary
 * without FIN, then continuations, the last with FIN (messageWriter.flushFrame in conn.go). A
 * capture of Xray 26.3.27 uploading 30 KB shows 4096 without FIN, 4096 with FIN, 34 with FIN, ...
 * Each frame is a separate socket write, so a separate TLS record. This code cuts and writes the
 * same way, one frame per write, so record sizes on the wire match the Xray client instead of
 * giving away another implementation. (Go's dynamic record sizing, small TLS records at the
 * start of a connection, is not repeated: our TLS has its own layout, shared by all transports.)
 *
 * Every frame has its own mask from kernel randomness (RFC 6455, 5.3: the client must mask, and
 * the key must be unpredictable, or a caching intermediary can be poisoned with chosen bytes).
 * Keys come in batches, 64 frames per getrandom: a syscall per 4 KB of upload shows on a router,
 * and a per-thread batch is just as unpredictable.
 *
 * RECEIVING as a stream (tr_ws_parse): the server (Xray: WriteMessage without a buffer) sends a
 * message as one unmasked frame, but the RFC allows fragments, control frames between them, and
 * frames up to 2^63 long, so the parser assumes nothing about boundaries and buffers only a frame
 * header and a control frame's body. RFC violations — a masked server frame, RSV bits without
 * negotiated extensions, a control frame over 125 bytes or fragmented, a continuation outside a
 * message or a new message inside an unfinished one, an unknown opcode — break the connection
 * (TR_EWSFRAME), as in gorilla: the stream after such a frame cannot be followed. Text frames are
 * read as binary: Xray does the same (connection.go reads NextReader without looking at the
 * type), and checking VLESS bytes for UTF-8 makes no sense.
 *
 * ping — a pong with the same body; pong — nothing; close — a close with the same code back
 * (gorilla's default answer) and end of stream. Data that came in the same chunk BEFORE the close
 * is returned, and end of stream comes with the next read.
 *
 * Closing the connection sends our own close 1000, as Xray does (connection.Close), with a
 * non-blocking write, see ws_close.
 *
 * EARLY DATA (Ed > 0, `?ed=N` in the path), byte for byte as Xray on the wire: the Upgrade
 * request waits for the first write; if that write is no longer than Ed it goes in
 * Sec-WebSocket-Protocol (base64url without padding), otherwise as frames after the 101 answer.
 * Until the answer arrives writes are queued and go right after it (ws_write, ws_read): Xray
 * blocks the write in its own goroutine meanwhile, but the tunnel loop must not wait. An Xray
 * server always accepts early data, whatever its own Ed (hub.go reads Sec-WebSocket-Protocol
 * unconditionally). */
