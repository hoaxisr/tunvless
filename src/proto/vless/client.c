/* Connection to a VLESS node and the check that the node accepted us.
 *
 * Reality has no negative answer. A server that does not recognise the client does not refuse:
 * it proxies the connection to the real site it hides behind. The handshake can complete, the
 * keys agree, TLS comes up, and it is still that site, not the tunnel.
 *
 * Only the first byte of the VLESS response tells them apart: the server answers with version 0,
 * the real site with anything else (HTTP, HTML, a redirect). So vless_probe() below is the only
 * honest check of a node, and the pool's health check uses it.
 *
 * Connection setup (TCP to every address, security, transports) lives in proto/transport. This
 * file holds what knows VLESS: the node as transport parameters and the probe by a VLESS request.

 * and talk to the real site; that connection works and a page loads, so without this check the
 * node would look healthy. The answer also measures latency over the path real traffic takes.
 *
 * Two targets, not one: a node may not pass a given address (the server's provider blocks it,
 * the hoster runs its own DNS on it, a rule on the server), and with a single target such a
 * node would be rejected as a whole. The second target is tried only when the target may be
